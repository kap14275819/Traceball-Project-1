## Game Description

#### The game is about surviving as long as possible. There is a chaser and a player, the player must use the mouse to move away from the chaser who will try and collide with the player position. Once the player has collided 3 times the game ends.

## User Stories

#### As a user I would like to play the game in my browser (cross platform)
#### As a user I would like to play the game multiple times (New game button)
#### As a user I would like to have my character move in a 2 dimensional enviroment
#### As a user I would like to have a visual representation of the player and NPC
#### As a user I should get feedback when there is a collision between the NPC and player
#### As a user I would like to know when I have won/lost the game
#### As a user I  would like to change the difficulty of the game to challenge myself

## Design Documentation:
### Process of Implementation

#### The first item that was created was the HTML page which will be the platform for the game to run on. Then the canvas was made so that there will be a playable area for both the NPC and player. Next was the mouse to be tracked on the screen to the canvas, when tracked the mouse was given a 2Dimensional image so that it looks more like a character. Once that was done the NPC was then created with a similar shape but different colour. This NPC was then given the position of the player so that it may track them and chase down the character. Finally when the NPC is following the users character its then was given a dectection so that when the two collide it will detect that they have hit and then will display that it has collided. The user character is then given 3 lives for when it has collided with the NPC.

### IDE used and Features

#### The type of Integrated Development Environment that was used was notepad. Even though notepad is a arguable IDE but unfortunately it has no redefining features which could have helped during the coding. It can only be used as an area to write code and save the file in relation to the type of code written.
